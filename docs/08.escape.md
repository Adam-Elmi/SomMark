# SomMark – Escape Character

SomMark uses:

```txt
\
```

The backslash escapes **only the next character**.

It removes the syntactic meaning of that character.

Example:

```js
\[
```

Outputs:

```txt
[
```

Instead of starting a Block.

## 1. When You Need Escaping

### A. Printing Syntax Characters

Escape structural tokens if you want them as plain text:

| Character | Write As |
| --------- | -------- |
| `[`       | `\[`     |
| `]`       | `\]`     |
| `(`       | `\(`     |
| `)`       | `\)`     |
| `@`       | `\@`     |
| `\`       | `\\`     |
| `#`       | `\#`     |

---

### B. Block Arguments

Block arguments support both:

* Positional values
* Key-value pairs using `:`

Example (valid key-value):

```
[Config = x:y][end]
```

Here:

* `x` is the key
* `y` is the value

#### Literal Colon Inside Value

If you want the **value itself** to contain a colon, you must escape it:

```
[Config = x\:y][end]
```

Now the argument is treated as a single positional value `x:y`,
not a key-value pair.

---

### C. Equal Sign Rule (Important)

The equal sign `=` is recognized only when it directly follows an Identifier token, because it defines Block arguments:

```
[Block = arg1][end]
```

However, inside a key-value pair, if the **first character of a value is `=`**, the parser may misinterpret it.

Problematic example:

```
[Block = A:=1][end]
```

Why this fails:

* `A:` is parsed as a key.
* Parser expects a value after `:`.
* `=` is interpreted structurally.
* This causes a parsing error.

#### Correct Way

Escape the equal sign if it is the first character of a value:

```ini
[Block = A:\=1][end]
```

Now the value is treated literally as `=1`.

### Rule

If `=` is the **first character of a Block argument value**, it must be escaped:

```js
\=
```

---

### D. Atblock Arguments

Atblock arguments use:

* `:` for key-value separation
* `;` to terminate arguments

If you want these characters as literal text, escape them.

Example:

```txt
@_Data_@: key\:value\;test;
Plain text
@_end_@
```

---

### E. Inline Statements

Inline arguments **do not use key-value pairs**.

Colon `:` inside inline arguments is treated as normal text.

No escaping required.

Example:

```js
(value)->(Print: x:y:z)
```

Valid.

---

## 2. Quick Rules

* Escape character: `\`

* Escapes only the next character

* Required for:

  * Printing syntax symbols (`[ ] ( ) @ \`)
  * `:` in Block arguments (when literal)
  * `:` and `;` in Atblock arguments (when literal)
  * `=` when it is the first character of a Block argument value

* Not required for `:` in Inline arguments

---

## 3. Example Inside a Block

Since everything must be inside a Block:

```ini
[Example]
This prints a literal bracket: \[
[end]
```

---

## 4. Backslash Itself

To print a backslash:

```js
\\
```

Outputs:

```txt
\
```

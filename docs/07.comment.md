# SomMark Comments

SomMark supports comments similar to Python, but when transpiled, comments are converted into the **target format’s comment style** if the format supports comments.

---

## 1. Single-Line Comments

Start a line with `#`:

```ini
# This is a comment
[Block]
Hello World!
[end]
```

**Behavior:**

* In **HTML**, transpiled as:

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
<div>Hello World!</div>
```

* In **Markdown**, transpiled as:

```markdown
<!-- This is a comment -->
Hello World!
```

* In **MDX**, transpiled as:

```mdx
{/* This is a comment */}
Hello World!
```

* In **Plain Text**, comments are usually **removed** or ignored.

---

## 2. Inline Comments

Comments can also appear at the end of a line:

```ini
[Block]
Hello World!  # This is an inline comment
[end]
```

* The inline comment is transpiled in the same way as a top-level comment.

---

## 3. Notes

* Comments can appear **inside or outside blocks**, but **inline statements and At-Blocks must be inside a block**.
* A `#` inside **strings or arguments** is treated as literal text.
* SomMark will convert comments to **valid syntax for the chosen output format**, so your HTML/MDX/Markdown stays valid.

### Example

```ini
# Top-level comment
[Section = class:main]  # Section with a comment

(Click Me)->(Link: https://example.com)  # Inline statement with comment
[end]
```

**Transpiled to HTML:**

```html
<!-- Top-level comment -->
<div class="main">
  <!-- Section with a comment -->
  <a href="https://example.com">Click Me</a>  <!-- Inline statement with comment -->
</div>
```

> [!Tip]
> Use comments for documentation inside your `.smark` files. They are preserved in output and remain readable in HTML, Markdown, or MDX.
